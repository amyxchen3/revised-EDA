# Revised EDA Notebook
This research project is conducted by Amy Chen and Marc Margolis for the Technical Writing course at the Emory College of Arts and Sciences.
### Project Objectives
This project aims to investigate the relationships between undergraduate college majors, postgraduate employment opportunities, and financial stability. In our analysis, we used broad major categories as the independent variable and  annual salary, employment rate, and full-time employment rate as dependent variables to measure economic success and career outlook. We also analyzed how different majors varied in terms of gender composition to illuminate any gender disparities and cultural implications.

## Project Description
Our projects aims to investigate the widespread belief among college students that undergraduate college majors affect future employment and earning potential. This belief stems from differeent cultural stereotypes that influence the perception of certain majors; STEM majors are associated with high intelligence and merit while humanities and social sciences can be deemed as "useless" or impractical.  Therefore, we decided to examine the correlation between broad academic disciplines and outcomes such as income, employment, and job stability. Persistent gender stereotypes can also steer men and women to different academic and career paths. Fields involving caring or emotional labor have strong associations with feminity and often go unrecognized in our society. These gender norms can have significant impacts on the gender composition of college majors and their corresponding industry in the job market, prompting us to look at the proportion of female graduates in our analysis. 

To explore our research objectives, we used data from the American Community Survey (2010-2012), which contains information on participants' undergraduate major, current employment status, annual salary, and demographic characteristics. This randomized survey is conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau across all U.S. counties, ensuring that the data is nationally representative and unbiased. In our study, we used the tidyverse package in RStudio to produce bar graphs and box plots to visualize correlation between our variables of interest. While our results illustrated clear correlations between the independent and dependent variables, we did not perform any statistical tests to determine the significance of these findings due to our limited technical understanding of R. These statistical tests are required to ensure the validity of our conclusions. Our graphing also leaned towards simplistic visualizations as we have not yet explored how to work with more complex packages. Nonetheless, the findings from our study raised the following questions: 
* How educational systems encourage women to explore STEM fields and prevent attrition? How can STEM programs become more inclusive and accessible to women?
* As a society, how can we bridge the pay gaps between different industries and recognize the contributions of different academic disciplines?
