# Revised EDA Notebook
This research project is conducted by Amy Chen and Marc Margolis for the Technical Writing course at the Emory College of Arts and Sciences.
### Project Objectives
This project aims to investigate the relationships between undergraduate college majors, postgraduate employment opportunities, and financial stability. In our analysis, we used broad major categories as the independent variable and  annual salary, employment rate, and full-time employment rate as dependent variables to measure economic success and career outlook. We also analyzed how different majors varied in terms of gender composition to illuminate any gender disparities and cultural implications.
